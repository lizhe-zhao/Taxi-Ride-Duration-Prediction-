# Taxi-Ride-Duration-Prediction-
•	Used SQL to load 1.1 million taxi trips data records from NYC Taxi and Limosine Commission into MySql Database
•	Performed regression modeling with linear regression, multivariate regression, and principal component analysis (PCA) by using Python to find the most influential factors that affect the duration of a taxi ride
•	Processed multicollinearity analysis, R square, MSE and residual plots to compare different model results in order to achieve a final prediction model
